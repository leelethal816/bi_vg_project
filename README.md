# Business Intelligence Video Game Sales Analysis Project

### In this project, our business intelligence team used R to analyze online video game sales in history. Our analysis answered the following business questions: 

#### Which genres of video games have the most sales and least sales?
#### Do specific publishers sell more games, and is that because they have more games in the market or something else?
#### What is the distribution for both Metacritic scores and user ratings historically for video games?
#### What is the relationship between Metacritic scores, user ratings and global sales?
#### What factors matter the most in predicting a game's sales number?

### We used statistical tests like correlation test and chi-squared test to test the significance of our results.

### From our data analysis, we can conclude that the following variables matter in helping business managers make informed decision:
#### Game genre, Publishers, Metacritic Score, User Score
